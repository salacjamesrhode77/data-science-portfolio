# Project Overview

A group of investors aims to enter the US coffee market by utilizing insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test." They seek recommendations in three areas:

- Identify the target audience and their preferences
- Determine the optimal coffee beans and drinks to offer, and
- Develop a pricing strategy that aligns with customer value perception

As a data scientist, your task is to analyze the taste test dataset, employ KMeans clustering to identify the target audience, and conduct explanatory data analysis to generate actionable insights for the marketing team.
